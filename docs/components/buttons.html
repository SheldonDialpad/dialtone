        <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">Dialtone provides three levels of visual importance for buttons within three different visual styles. The three levels of visual importance are:</p>
        <ol class="dialtone-copy__normal">
            <li><strong>Clear:</strong> This button communicates the least importance. It offers no background or border color. It appears as a link with matching padding. This is typically used for secondary or minimally important actions. This is the default importance level of all buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Outlined:</strong> This button communicates slightly more importance than clear. It provides a border color, but no background color.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary:</strong> This is the highest visual importance a button can have. It provides a border and a background color.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">These button styles are provided in three visual styles are:</p>
        <ol class="dialtone-copy__normal">
            <li><strong>Default / Blue:</strong> Our normal blue button colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Danger:</strong> Buttons associated with potentially destructive actions. Appears as red.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverted:</strong> For scenarios when you want to place a button on a non-white.</li>
